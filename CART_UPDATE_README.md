# Cart Functionality Update - Error Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### ? **Naming Conflict Resolved**
- **Problem**: Multiple components with the same name "Cart" causing build errors
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate `Cart.razor` page component, keeping only the main `Cart.razor` component and the dedicated `CartPage.razor`

### ? **Bootstrap Modal Integration Improved**
- **Problem**: Cart modal might not open due to Bootstrap JS loading issues
- **Solution**: Added robust JavaScript fallbacks with timeout handling and CSS-based modal display as backup

### ? **Error Handling Enhanced**
- **Problem**: Components could crash on service failures
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout all components with graceful degradation

### ? **Loading States Added**
- **Problem**: No visual feedback during operations
- **Solution**: Added loading spinners and disabled states for:
  - Cart modal loading
  - Add to cart operations
  - Cart quantity updates
  - Checkout process

### ? **Image Fallbacks Implemented**
- **Problem**: Broken images when product images fail to load
- **Solution**: Added `onerror` handlers with SVG placeholder fallbacks

### ? **CSS Issues Resolved**
- **Problem**: CSS media queries in component styles causing build errors
- **Solution**: Moved all styles to global CSS file with proper responsive design

### ? **Navigation Robustness**
- **Problem**: Cart modal failures could leave users stuck
- **Solution**: Added fallback navigation to cart page when modal fails

### ? **Double-Click Prevention**
- **Problem**: Users could accidentally add items multiple times
- **Solution**: Added loading states and disabled buttons during operations
